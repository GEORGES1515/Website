      <h1>Network Infrastructure Definition</h1>
    Network infrastructure is the broader collection of fundamental components
    that work cohesively to run an IT network and is a critical part of an
    organization’s IT infrastructure. Since an organization relies on its IT
    network to run mission-critical applications and business operations,
    ensuring the underlying network infrastructure is reliable, safe, robust,
    and scalable is crucial.
    <h1>What does a network infrastructure consist of?</h1>
    Network infrastructure can be a mix of hardware devices, software
    applications, and network services, including: o Hardware infrastructure
    typically includes routers, switches, hubs, repeaters, gateways, bridges,
    and modems. o Software infrastructure includes monitoring and management
    tools and operating systems. o Network services include networking protocols
    such as TCP, UDP, and IP addressing. An organization can extend its IT
    network by integrating with third-party services from managed service
    providers (MSPs) or build hybrid network infrastructure by integrating
    on-premises infrastructure with cloud services.
    <h1>A History of the World Wide Web From 1989 to the Present Day</h1>
    The World Wide Web was created all the way back in 1989. Here's a look at
    the history of the web as we know it, up to the present day. The World Wide
    Web is a collection of billions of interlinked websites accessible on the
    global computer network known as the internet. Wide area networking (WANs)
    predated the World Wide Web for decades. However, it wasn’t until Tim
    Berners Lee invented websites in 1989 that the internet of today was truly
    born. The World Wide Web has been evolving ever since. So, here we take a
    look at the history of the WWW from its conception in 1989 up to the present
    in 2023.
    <h2>1989-1993: Tim Berners-Lee Invents the World Wide Web</h2>
    Tim Berners-Lee was a scientist working at CERN (European Organization for
    Nuclear Research) in the late 1980s and early ‘90s. CERN’s need to share
    data prompted Tim Berners-Lee to submit a draft proposal for a new kind of
    distributed information system. That document outlined the idea of linking
    pages with hypertext. In 1990, Lee submitted another document titled
    “WorldWideWeb” that included an extended outline for a new hypertext
    project. By the end of 1990, Tim had laid the foundations of the modern-day
    World Wide Web. He developed the first web browser, which was called
    WorldWideWeb. You can see what that browser was like on this WorldWideWeb
    page. Tim also established the world’s first server on his NeXT computer in
    1990. Everything was then ready for the first website in 1991. Tim hosted
    the first website on his NeXT server titled “World Wide Web” in that year.
    It provided a brief introduction to the World Wide Web by describing it as a
    wide-area information initiative for accessing many documents. That first
    website remains online today, and you can view it on a dedicated CERN site.
    The final milestone in the early development of the World Wide Web came in
    1993. Then Tim Berners-Lee and CERN submitted a document placing the web in
    the public domain. That document further defined the World Wide Web and
    confirmed CERN did not claim any intellectual ownership rights of it.
    Therefore, nobody owns the Web as CERN adopted an open for all policy.
    <h2>1992-1995: The First Graphical Browsers</h2>
    The WorldWideWeb browser Tim developed was little more than a text editor.
    It wasn’t until 1992 the first graphical browsers that could handle images
    emerged. Young programmers in Finland developed the first graphical browser
    and named it Erwise. However, the developers of Erwise did not seek to
    commercialize it, and the browser never took off. NCSA released Mosaic in
    1993, the first graphical browser that popularized browsing. Mosaic could
    display images alongside text. Users could now view websites that
    incorporated text, images, videos, and sound for the first time within
    Mosaic. Mosaic soon became the biggest browser, with a user base eclipsing
    the one-million mark. However, Mosaic would not remain the world’s foremost
    web browser for long. Microsoft released Internet Explorer in 1995 and
    bundled it with their Windows platforms. Internet Explorer emerged
    victorious in the first browser war, with a user base share reaching the 90
    percent mark in its heyday. Internet Explorer has quite a history itself,
    but we won't dive into that too much here.
    <h2>1995: JavaScript Shakes Up the Web</h2>
    Websites during the World Wide Web’s early years were rather basic. However,
    that started to change in 1995 when the programmer Brandan Eich developed
    the JavaScript scripting language for webpages. JavaScript soon became one
    of the core languages for website development alongside HTML and CSS. It
    enabled website designers to add interactive elements to pages and create
    more dynamic sites.
    <h2>1995-2000: The Dot.com Boom</h2>
    It didn’t take long for the first entrepreneurs to recognize the commercial
    potential of websites during the dot.com boom. Jeff Bezos founded the Amazon
    site in 1995. Though Bezos originally called it Cadabara (a magical spell),
    he later chose Amazon, one of the world’s longest rivers, to be the name.
    Amazon started as a website selling books but expanded to sell much, much
    more as it became the world’s largest online retailer. The computer
    scientists Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded the Google search engine and
    company during 1997-1998. The Google search engine was originally called
    BackRub, but Brin and Page soon renamed it. It was supposed to be called
    Googol, but a typo established the Google domain name. That search engine
    quickly became one of the most popular tools for finding webpages, and Mr.
    Brin and Page established the Google company in 1998.
    <h2>1999-2003: The First Blogging Platforms Were Established</h2>
    Blogs (online web diaries and journals) became the new big thing on the
    World Wide Web during 1999-2003. Blogger was one of the first notable
    blogging platforms established in 1999 that enabled users to set up online
    journals from templates. Users could now establish an online presence
    without needing to design and upload websites with software. WordPress was
    another big blogging platform founded a few years after Blogger in 2003. It
    started as a blog-publishing platform, much the same as Blogger. However, it
    was extended to become a broader web-publishing platform that enabled users
    to set up websites based on WordPress templates. Those websites include
    comment sections in which readers can reply to posts in much the same way as
    conventional blogs.
    <h2>2004-2006: The Rise of Social Media</h2>
    In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook. Facebook was among the first
    websites to popularize social media. Zuckerberg designed Facebook to be a
    blue site because of his red-green color-blinded vision. The sharing of
    content, opinions, and information via online communities and networks
    Facebook facilitated became known as social media. Twitter later expanded
    the social media phenomenon Facebook started. Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in
    2006, and it became one of Facebook’s biggest social media rivals, with
    explosive growth from 2009. Many users fell in love with Twitter’s tweet
    messaging, which made it a more popular social networking platform for
    journalism. This Twitter history walkthrough tells you about the Twitter
    story from 2006 up to Musk’s acquisition.
    <h2>2006: Google Unleashes Docs, Sheets, and Slides</h2>
    Cloud computing became the buzzword of the World Wide Web when Google
    launched the online Docs, Sheets, and Slides productivity apps in 2006.
    Those are the word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation applications of
    Google Workspace (originally Google Apps for Your Domain).Docs, Sheets, and
    Slides enable users to produce documents, spreadsheets, and presentation
    slideshows in their web browsers without installing any productivity
    software.
    <h2>2008-2012: Google Chrome Becomes the World’s Favorite Web Browser</h2>
    Internet Explorer was still the world’s foremost web browser by 2008. It
    might have remained the king of browsers had Larry Page and Sergey Brin
    listened to the then Google CEO Eric Schmidt in 2008. Schmidt rejected the
    proposal for a Google web browser because he was convinced Microsoft would
    kill such a product. However, Page and Brin didn’t listen and enlisted
    former Firefox developers to develop a demo version of Chrome. Those
    developers later duly informed Schmidt of the new Chrome browser, leaving
    the Google CEO little choice but to approve it. Google duly released Chrome
    in 2008, which overtook Internet Explorer’s user base in 2012 to become the
    world’s favorite web browser.
    <h2>2015: Microsoft Launches Edge</h2>
    Microsoft could only watch in horror as Internet Explorer’s user share
    plummeted in the years after. As Internet Explorer struggled to compete with
    Chrome, the big M released the Edge browser in 2015. After a bit of a slow
    start, Edge has grown in stature since Microsoft converted it to a Chromium
    engine. However, Chrome still has a considerably bigger user base than Edge.
    <h2>2020: HTML 5 Replaces Adobe Flash</h2>
    Adobe Flash was once the dominant multimedia content format on the World
    Wide Web. It was used for adding multimedia content, such as animations and
    videos, to websites. Many website games were also based on Adobe Flash.
    However, things began to change after the introduction of HTML 5 from 2008
    onward. HTML 5 is the most advanced HyperText Markup Language version that
    has now largely replaced Adobe Flash. Steve Jobs snubbed Flash on Apple’s
    iPhones in favor of HTML 5. Flash’s security vulnerabilities were another
    significant factor in its demise. Consequently, Adobe discontinued Flash
    support in 2020.
    <h2>2022-2023: The Web 3.0 Boom and the Coming of AI</h2>
    Web 3.0 is the next iteration of the World Wide Web, which Tim Berners-Lee
    has spoken about with news channels in recent years. That is the next stage
    of the web Tim envisages will be more decentralized with a bottom-up design.
    Tim has also spoken about AI being a big part of the web’s future evolution,
    with more AI assistants like ChatGPT supporting browsing.

      Since 2013, internet use has increased significantly to at or near
      saturation levels in all Arab countries in this study; in Jordan the rate
      approaches that in the U.S. and internet penetration surpasses the U.S. in
      the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Lebanon. The increase in internet users
      from 2013 to 2019 is particularly striking in Egypt (53 percentage
      points), Jordan (41 points), Lebanon (36 points), and Tunisia (27 points
      since 2014).

    Younger and more highly-educated nationals continue to use the internet at
    higher rates than older and less-educated respondents, but these gaps are
    decreasing (age: 18-24 year-olds: 76% in 2013 vs. 97% in 2019, 25-34
    year-olds: 68% vs. 94%, 35-44 year-olds: 45% vs. 86%, 45+ year-olds: 23% vs.
    65%; education: primary or less: 5% in 2013 vs. 36% in 2019, intermediate:
    35% vs. 73%, secondary: 64% vs. 91%, university or higher 83% vs. 96%). Use
    of the internet in Arabic tracks with overall internet use, while only about
    three in 10 nationals in 2019 say they use the internet in English.
    Additionally, while the percentages of nationals who use the internet and
    who use the internet in Arabic each increased by about 30 percentage points
    between 2013 and 2019, the share that uses the internet in English only
    increased by 10 points.
    <hr />
    <img src="pictures/pic2.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
    While almost all nationals access Arabic internet content, use of English
    online varies widely by country, from about half of nationals in Lebanon,
    Qatar, and the UAE, to one in five Egyptians. Notably, though, compared to
    2013, use of English online increased substantially in Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
    Jordan, and the UAE (use English online: Qatar: 48% in 2013 vs. 48% in 2019;
    Lebanon: 46% vs. 51%, UAE: 22% vs. 46%, Tunisia: 22% vs. 24%, Jordan: 12%
    vs. 23%, KSA: 9% vs. 27%, Egypt: 5% vs. 21%). Men, younger nationals, and
    those with more education are more likely than their counterparts to use the
    internet in English (gender: 33% men vs. 28% women; age: 43% 18-24
    year-olds, 38% 25-34 year-olds, 27% 35-44 year-olds, 13% 45+ year-olds;
    education: 2% primary or less, 12% intermediate, 31% secondary, 46%
    university or higher).

    <h1>Can you use non-latin characters in URLs?</h1>
    Regardless of what you place within your URLs, make it easy for folks to
    link to your pages. For example, avoid using spaces, commas and other
    special characters in the URL. They work for Google, but they make linking a
    little bit harder. Use dashes to separate words in your URLs. Sme prefer
    using underscores; that’s fine, too. Dashes are usually a little bit easier
    to recognize. And if your site is available in multiple languages, use the
    appropriate language in URLs for content in that language. So to sum it up,
    yes, non-English words and URLs are fine, [and] we recommend using them for
    non-English websites.
    <br />1. IDNA2003 (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications): The
    first standardized version of IDNs, known as IDNA2003, was introduced in
    2003. It allowed domain names to include non-ASCII characters by encoding
    them in a compatible format called Punycode. For example, a domain name like
    "example.com" could be represented as "xn--example.com" in Punycode.
    <br />2. IDNA2008 (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications): In 2008,
    an updated standard called IDNA2008 was introduced to improve the handling
    of internationalized domain names. This version expanded support for a wider
    range of characters from various scripts and improved security and
    compatibility. <br />3. Unicode Integration: As IDNs evolved, support for a
    broader range of Unicode characters and scripts was incorporated. This
    allowed domain names to more accurately represent the characters from
    different languages and scripts. <br />4. Browser and Application Support:
    Over time, web browsers and other internet applications started to better
    support IDNs, making it easier for users to navigate websites with non-Latin
    characters in the domain names. <br />5. Registry Support: Domain name
    registries, the organizations responsible for managing and distributing
    domain names for specific top-level domains (TLDs), gradually added support
    for IDNs, allowing website owners to register domain names with non-Latin
    characters. <br />6. Internationalized Top-Level Domains (IDN TLDs): Some
    TLDs have been introduced specifically to support non-Latin scripts. For
    example, there are TLDs like .рф (for Russia) and .中国 (for China) that
    allow domain names entirely in non-Latin characters. <br />It's important to
    note that while IDNs have greatly expanded internet accessibility for
    non-Latin script users, they can also introduce potential security and
    phishing concerns. Therefore, various measures have been implemented to
    mitigate these risks, including careful validation of domain names, use of
    homographic detection, and user education.

      http is a stateless protocol . How can servers recognize the user in his
      2nd and 3rd entries?
    </h1>
    HTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the
    server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of
    multiple requests. But some web applications may have to track the user's
    progress from page to page, for example when a web server is required to
    customize the content of a web page for a user. Solutions for these cases
    include:
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>the use of HTTP cookies.</li>
      <li>server side sessions,</li>
      <li>hidden variables (when the current page contains a form), and</li>
      <li>
        URL-rewriting using URI-encoded parameters, e.g.,
        /index.php?session_id=some_unique_session_code.
