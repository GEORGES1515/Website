                  The "Web Programming" course is a core requirement for Computer Engineering students and serves as a
                  major elective for those majoring in Electrical, Telecommunications, or Biomedical Engineering. This course is
                  designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side web
                  programming, encompassing a wide range of essential technologies and skills.
                  Throughout the course, students will delve into fundamental topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM
                  (Document Object Model), PHP, and MySQL. These technologies form the building blocks of modern web
                  development, enabling students to create interactive and dynamic web applications. Additionally, students
                  will gain proficiency in XML and DTD (Document Type Definition) for structured data representation and
                  exchange, further enhancing their web programming capabilities.
                  By the end of this course, students will be well-versed in web development, equipped with the knowledge and
                  skills needed to design, build, and maintain sophisticated web applications. Whether pursuing a career in
                  computer engineering or related fields, this course provides a solid foundation for success in the digital world.</td>

                The "Web Programming" course employs an engaging and dynamic delivery mode designed to immerse
        students in the world of web development. All sessions include hands-on learning activities where students
        apply newly acquired web technologies, ensuring immediate practical reinforcement of their knowledge. The
        course engages students in active learning through the Project-Based Learning (PBL) teaching approach. From
        day one, students are tasked with constructing a personal website. They begin with a blank canvas and
        progressively incorporate recently learned web technologies throughout the semester. This immersive
        approach enables students to culminate their learning experience with a polished and professional website,
        showcasing their mastery of major web development tools and techniques.

            The USEK <b>Academic Rules and Regulations</b> is the official document of record concerning academic programs
        and regulations. It can be found at <a href="www.usek.edu.lb">www.usek.edu.lb .</a>
        <div class="titles1">Class attendance policy</div>
        Students can, for valid and justified reasons, be absent for a number of teaching hours equal to three teaching
        weeks (20% of the course’s number of hours, i.e., 9 hours = 6 sessions of an hour and 15 minutes each).
        However, they are responsible for learning material covered in class and will fail all graded class activities
        (quizzes, tests, presentations, discussions, etc.) organized during these absences. <br>
        Students who exceed the authorized limit of absences will not be allowed to sit for their final exam. They
        must officially withdraw from the course before the official deadline, otherwise, they will be given the grade
        FW (Fail to Withdraw).
        Students with an excused absence will be permitted to make up coursework or complete an equivalent
        assignment agreed upon with the instructor.
        <div class="titles1">Absence to Mid-term and final exam</div>
        A student who does not show up for the Mid-term and final exams, for any reason, is given, by the teacher, a
        failing grade of zero. If this absence is due to special justifiable circumstances, such as:<br>
        • Death of a family member or relative.<br>
        • Hospitalization, attested by a medical report from the hospital.<br>
        • Tested positive to COVID‐19, attested by a PCR test with a QR code.<br>
        • Serious accident, attested by an official report from a sworn expert.<br>
        Then the student can present a petition with supporting documents at the Student Affairs Office within the 24
        hours following the missed exam. The request will be accepted for a valid justification or in case of a recurrence.
        A student who has shown up for the exam cannot, in any case, present a petition for a make-up exam.
        The Mid-term and final exams policy can be found at <a href="www.usek.edu.lb">www.usek.edu.lb</a> .
        <div class="titles1">Late Submission</div>
        Assignments are expected to be submitted by the designated deadlines. Late submissions may result in grade
        penalties unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.
        <div class="titles1">Academic Integrity</div>
        Plagiarism and any form of academic dishonesty are strictly prohibited. All work submitted must be your own,
        unless otherwise specified.
        Students are expected to practice the highest possible standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this
        expectation will result in an academic penalty of the student failing the assignment and may result in additional
        disciplinary measures. This includes, but not limited to, improper citation of sources, using another student's
        work, and any other form of academic misrepresentation. Suspicions of use of artificial intelligence aids will be
        considered as alleged violations of Cheating.
        The Academic Integrity policy can be found at <a href="www.usek.edu.lb">www.usek.edu.lb</a> . 
        <div class="titles1">Netiquette</div>
        Students are expected to communicate with each other and with the instructor in a learning community. They
        are expected to be respectful, polite, and knowledgeable during oral and written communication and when
        posting to the class discussion forums.
        <div class="titles1">Arrangements for Students with Special Needs</div>
        USEK empowers students to manage challenges and limitations imposed by special needs. Students with
        disabilities are encouraged to contact the Access Office by sending an email to <a href="accessoffice@usek.edu.lb">accessoffice@usek.edu.lb</a>, for
