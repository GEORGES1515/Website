      <h2>CSS History</h2>
    <div>•1994- HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.<br>
      •1996- The first version of CSS was invented.<br>
      •1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules. Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall specification, and either added new features or refined and extended existing features. All additions and enhancements to the specification were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS.<br>
      •2011- CSS 2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS 2</div>
      •Work on CSS3 began in 1998 a year after CSS2 was published. CSS3 is an extension of CSS 2.1 that adds features like transforms, animations, etc.
Divided into different modules of features that can be worked on separately

    <div>•The @import: rule imports another style sheet into the current style sheet.<br>

      •The @charset rule indicates the character set the style sheet uses.<br>
      
      •The @font-face rule is used to exhaustively describe a font face for use in a document.<br>
      
      •The !important rule indicates that a user-defined rule should take precedence over the author's style sheets.</div>
